# Authentication Module - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Q: How do I create an account?
**A:** Click the "Sign Up" link on the login page, fill in your first name, last name, email address, and password. Make sure your password meets the strength requirements. After submitting, your account will be created and you'll be automatically logged in.

### Q: What are the password requirements?
**A:** Your password should be at least 8 characters long. We recommend using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters for better security.

### Q: Can I use the same email for multiple accounts?
**A:** No, each email address can only be associated with one account. If you try to sign up with an email that's already registered, you'll need to use the login page instead or use a different email address.

### Q: What should I do if I forget my password?
**A:** Click "Forgot Password" on the login page, enter your email address, and we'll send you a password reset link. Click the link in the email to set a new password. The link expires after a certain time for security.

### Q: How long does the password reset link last?
**A:** Password reset links expire after a set period (typically 24 hours) for security reasons. If your link has expired, you can request a new one from the login page.

## Login Questions

### Q: I can't log in. What should I do?

### Q: Why do I see "Invalid credentials"?
**A:** This means the email and password combination doesn't match our records. Double-check your email address and password. If you've forgotten your password, use the "Forgot Password" link.
